// check-paths.mjs — resolve every backticked relative file reference in the pack
// and exit 1 if any does not exist. Also simulates the Copilot install by
// copying adapters/copilot/.github/ to a scratch repository and re-resolving,
// because that adapter's references have to hold OUTSIDE this pack.
//
// Ported from agency/scripts/check-paths.mjs (agency 1.4.0, task #586 item 2),
// where nine of twelve adapter agent files shipped a ROLE-CORE.md path that
// resolved nowhere, through three releases, because nothing checked. Studio's
// Copilot agent file shipped the sharper version of the same defect: its
// ../../../../contracts/ path RESOLVED inside the pack and broke only once
// .github/ was copied into another workspace. The scratch-workspace scan below
// is the only scan that can catch that, which is why it is not optional.
